## Goals
Data-driven methods to study history are limited due to the lack of validated quantitative time series data. The data on history almost is entirely comprised of text-based, qualitative data. Therefore, we aim to develop a neural network-based methodology to study the sequuence of events in history, in an attempt to create easily an interpretable "line graph of history".

A few challenges need to be addressed. To name a few:
1. A Named-entity Recognition task to identify what is an event and what is not. 
2. The "quantification" of events in order to determine the importance or relevance of events over time.
3. An event type detection to ensure that events that are being linked together chare a common topical relevance.



Try to use a pre-trained bidirectional model (BERT) to classify importance or relevance of events based on seperate events created or linked to the original event.
We will use the wikipedia corpus to gather data of events.
