Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure,"The Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure (MTEL) program was initiated by the Massachusetts Department of Education in 1998. It is part of a statewide education reform initiative for educators seeking pre-kindergarten to Grade 12 licenses. The MTEL program includes a test of communication and literacy skills as well as tests of subject matter knowledge. The tests are designed to ensure that Massachusetts educators can communicate adequately with students, parents/guardians, and other educators and that they are knowledgeable in the subject matter of the license sought. The MTEL program was expanded in November 2004 to include tests for candidates seeking vocational technical and adult basic education licenses.
The MTEL is developed, administered, and scored by National Evaluation Systems, Inc. (NES), which is now known as the Evaluation Systems group of Pearson Education.  Tests are scored on a criterion-based system, where examinees must attain a certain score based on standards established by the state. Constructed (written & oral) components of the tests are scored using a focused holistic scoring model (similar to holistic grading).  Like regular holistic scoring, responses are viewed for their overall quality, not just for individual mistakes.  However this is done according to specific criteria that the state has established (i.e., grammar, support, etc.).  These criteria vary by test and assignment.
It is accepted in a few other states as a credential for teaching. The MTEL is a unique set of tests, whereas all other states in New England use the Praxis test, which have been adopted by 40 other states.
A wide variety of MTEL assessments are available, including:

Over 200 counties and municipalities have enacted ordinances either imposing a fee on plastic bags or banning them outright, including all counties in Hawaii.
Some attempts at banning plastic shopping bags statewide (for example in Massachusetts, though as of May 2023, 162 of the 301 cities and towns in the state have done so) have not succeeded mainly due to plastic industry lobbying. A few jurisdictions have chosen to implement a fee-only approach to bag reduction such as Washington, D.C., Montgomery County, Maryland, and certain counties and independent cities in Virginia. Some states, such as Florida, Arizona, and Missouri, have passed laws preventing local municipalities from passing their own bans.

Different definitions exist in some countries, but in the United States, light rail operates primarily along exclusive rights-of-way and uses either individual tramcars or multiple units coupled together, with a lower capacity and speed than a long heavy rail passenger train or rapid transit system.
Narrowly defined, light rail transit uses rolling stock that is similar to that of a traditional tram, while operating at a higher capacity and speed, often on an exclusive right-of-way. In broader use, it includes tram-like operations mostly on streets. A few light rail networks have characteristics closer to rapid transit or even commuter rail, yet only when these systems are fully grade-separated are they referred to as light metros.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_rail,Not an Event

Hat brim,"A hat brim is that part of a hat that extends outwards and to the side of the head, protruding from the base of the crown.

The brim protects the eyes from both sun glare and precipitation. The broader the brim, the greater its protection function, but the easier it is for the hat to blow off due to the larger surface area available for the wind to act on.
Hat brims are often decorative, for example, on very wide women's hats.
If a brim-like element is only attached to part of a hat, it is called a cap and this partial brim is known as a peak if at the front, a havelock if it protects the neck, or ear flaps if at the side.
In forensic medicine there is the so -called ""hat brim rule"", whereby an injury located above the hat brim line is probably the result of a blow to the head, whereas a fall would result in a wound at the hat brim level.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder,"Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized by emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms. PMDD causes significant distress or impairment in menstruating women during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms occur in the luteal phase (between ovulation and menstruation), improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and are minimal or absent in the week after menses. PMDD has a profound impact on a woman’s quality of life and dramatically increases the risk of suicidal ideation and even suicide attempts. Many women of reproductive age experience discomfort or mild mood changes prior to menstruation. However, 5–8% experience severe premenstrual syndrome causing significant distress or functional impairment. Within this population of reproductive age, some will meet the criteria for PMDD. 
The exact cause of PMDD is currently unknown. Ovarian hormone levels during the menstrual cycle do not differ between individuals with PMDD and the general population. However, because the symptoms are only present during ovulatory cycles and resolve after menstruation,  it is believed to be caused by fluctuations in gonadal sex hormones or variations in sensitivity to sex hormones.
In 2017, researchers at the National Institutes of Health discovered that women with PMDD have genetic changes that make their emotional regulatory pathways more sensitive to estrogen and progesterone, as well as their chemical derivatives. The researchers believe that this increased sensitivity may be responsible for PMDD symptoms.
Studies have found that those with PMDD are more at risk of developing postpartum depression after pregnancy. PMDD was added to the list of depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013. It has 11 main symptoms, and a woman has to exhibit at least five to be diagnosed with PMDD. Roughly 20% of females have some symptoms of PMDD, but either have less than five or do not have functional impairment.
First line treatment for PMDD is with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can be administered continuously throughout the menstrual cycle or intermittently, with treatment only during the symptomatic phase (approximately 14 days per cycle). Hormonal therapy with oral contraceptives that contain drospirenone have demonstrated efficiency in reducing PMDD symptoms as well. Cognitive behavioral therapy, whether in combination with SSRIs or alone, has shown to be effective in reducing impairment. Dietary modifications and exercise may also be helpful, but studies investigating these treatments have not demonstrated efficacy in reducing PMDD symptoms.

Radar-equipped F-82s were used extensively by the Air Defense Command as replacements for the Northrop P-61 Black Widow as all-weather day/night interceptors. During the Korean War, Japan-based F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea. The first three North Korean aircraft destroyed by U.S. forces were shot down by F-82s, the first being a North-Korean Yak-11 downed over Gimpo Airfield by the USAF 68th Fighter Squadron.

It is one of the three most important parts of the general fossil fuel phase-out process, the others being the phase-out of fossil fuel power plants for electricity generation and decarbonisation of industry.
Many countries and cities around the world have stated they will ban the sale of passenger vehicles (primarily cars and buses) powered by fossil fuels such as petrol, liquefied petroleum gas, and diesel at some time in the future. Synonyms for the bans include phrases like ""banning gas cars"", ""banning petrol cars"", ""the petrol and diesel car ban"", or simply ""the diesel ban"".
