The Tree (play),"In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. 
Trees are not a monophyletic taxonomic group but consist of a wide variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms or softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees evolved around 370 million years ago, and it is estimated that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world currently.
A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk, which typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees the trunk is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.
Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowering plants have their seeds inside fruits, while conifers carry their seeds in cones, and tree ferns produce spores instead.
Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In much of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree,Not an Event

Customer satisfaction research,"Customer satisfaction is a term frequently used in marketing to evaluate customer experience. It is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. Customer satisfaction is defined as ""the number of customers, or percentage of total customers, whose reported experience with a firm, its products, or its services (ratings) exceeds specified satisfaction goals."" Enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering customer loyalty are pivotal for businesses, given the significant importance of improving the balance between customer attitudes before and after the consumption process.
Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory is the most widely accepted theoretical framework for explaining customer satisfaction. However, other frameworks, such as Equity Theory, Attribution Theory, Contrast Theory, Assimilation Theory, and various others, are also used to gain insights into customer satisfaction. However, traditionally applied satisfaction surveys are influence by biases related to social desirability, availability heuristics, memory limitations, respondents' mood while answering questions, as well as affective, unconscious, and dynamic nature of customer experience. 
The Marketing Accountability Standards Board endorses the definitions, purposes, and measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 71 percent responded that they found a customer satisfaction metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses. Customer satisfaction is viewed as a key performance indicator within business and is often part of a Balanced Scorecard. In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a major differentiator and increasingly has become an important element of business strategy.

Kaman SH-2 Seasprite,"The Kaman SH-2 Seasprite is a ship-based helicopter originally developed and produced by American manufacturer Kaman Aircraft Corporation. It has been typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. Early on it was modest sized single-engined naval utility helicopter, and progressed to twin-engine ASW and SAR, and the latest model served well into the 21st century, with G model in active service in the 2020s with Egypt, New Zealand, Peru, and Poland.
The Seasprite, with the internal Kaman designation K-20, was developed in the late 1950s in response to a United States Navy (USN) requirement for a suitably fast and compact naval utility helicopter. The USN found the Seasprite attractive, and ordered four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters as the HU2K-1. Under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the HU2K and HU2K-1 were re-designated as H-2 and UH-2A respectively. Kaman also pursued foreign sales; after showing interest, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) rejected the Seasprite due to an unexpected price increase and underperformance during sea trials. The USN addressed the poor performance by converting the single-engine Seasprites into a more powerful twin-engine configuration from 1968.
In October 1970, the USN selected the Seasprite as the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter, resulting in the SH-2D/F variant with enhanced ASW and anti-surface warfare sensors. Most UH-2s were converted into SH-2Fs.
USN Seasprites were used for ASW, search and rescue (SAR), utility and plane guard for aircraft carriers. In the Vietnam War they were mainly used for combat search and rescue (CSAR), and combat support and surface warfare during the Gulf War. The SH-2G Super Seasprite was the last variant and — in 2001 — the last Seasprite to leave USN service. Retired USN Seasprites were offered as foreign aid in the 1990s and 2000s; this led to quite some interest and F and/or G models served with New Zealand, Poland, and Egypt. Retired models were also sent to aviation museums, and a number have been put on display. However, the latest upgraded models are still in frontline service with several navies around the world.

Modern history of American football,"The modern history of American football can be considered to have begun after the 1932 NFL Playoff Game, which was the first American football game to feature hash marks, the legalization of the forward pass anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line; it was also the first indoor game since 1902.  Other innovations to occur in the years after 1932 were the introduction of the AP Poll in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first Heisman Trophy in 1935, the first NFL draft in 1936, and the first televised game in 1939.  
Another important event was the American football game at the 1932 Summer Olympics, which combined with a similar demonstration game at the 1933 World's Fair, led to the first College All-Star Game in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States.  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the 1958 NFL Championship Game, a contest that has been dubbed the ""Greatest Game Ever Played"". A rival league to the NFL, the American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960.  In 1966, the NFL initiated the AFL–NFL merger between the two leagues.

5G Broadcast,"5G Broadcast (5GB), officially known as LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast, is a standard for the distribution of television and other media content via 5G cellular networks.
5G Broadcast focuses mainly on mobile use cases like smartphones. It does not require the use of a SIM card or cellular subscription, but only a device like a smartphone capable of receiving 5G Broadcast signals, thus bypassing telecommunication and cellular operators entirely. A stated advantage has been the ability to reduce load off mobile networks during large live broadcasts, and not requiring an internet connection. In a broadcast mode, data can be sent to multiple receivers at once (point-to-multipoint) as opposed to point-to-point.
The technology has been tested in numerous countries for a number of years, and has been tipped in Europe as the potential future for digital terrestrial television, which currently are mainly based on the DVB-T2 standard. Public broadcasters of France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria have signed a cooperation pact in 2023 and have stated the use of the UHF 470–694 MHz frequency band to be used for 5G Broadcast.

In Germany, 5G Broadcast has been trialed and in May 2024 another pilot project is set to begin in the city of Halle.

Drones in wildfire management,"Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Systems/Vehicles (UAS/UAV), or  Remotely Piloted Aircraft, are used in wildfire surveillance and suppression. They help in the detection, containment, and extinguishing of fires. They are also used for locating a hot spot, firebreak breaches, and then to deliver water to the affected site. In terms of maneuverability, these are superior to a helicopter or other forms of manned aircraft. They help firefighters determine where a fire will spread through tracking and mapping fire patterns. These empower scientists and incident personnel to make informed decisions. These devices can fly when and where manned aircraft are unable to fly. They are associated with low cost and are flexible devices that offer a high spatiotemporal resolution.
The data gathered through these devices is unique and accurate as they fly low, slow, and for a long period. They can also collect high-resolution imagery and sub-centimeter data in smoke and at night. It provides firefighters access to real-time data without putting the lives of pilots at risk. Managing a 24/7-drone fleet over any huge forestland is challenging. Public drones pose a danger to wildfire and can cost lives. Fire response agencies are forced to ground their aircraft to avoid the potential for a midair collision. Policies in the United States, Canada, and Australia discourage the use of public drones near wildfires.
