Conservative Anabaptism,"Conservative Anabaptism includes theologically conservative Anabaptist denominations, both in doctrine and practice. Conservative Anabaptists, along with Old Order Anabaptists and assimilated mainline Anabaptists, are a subset of the Anabaptist branch of Christianity.
Conservative Anabaptists adhere to Anabaptist doctrine, such as the belief in nonresistance and the observance of plain dress (including the headcovering), while making judicious use of modern technology. Ordinances commonly observed in many Conservative Anabaptist churches include ""baptism, communion, footwashing, marriage, anointing with oil, the holy kiss, and the prayer covering.""
Conservative Anabaptists may have Sunday school, hold revival meetings, or operate their own Christian schools (parochial schools). Additionally, Conservative Anabaptist fellowships are often engaged in evangelism and missionary work; a 1993 report showed that Conservative Anabaptist denominations in general grew by fifty percent overall within the previous fifteen years.
Among Conservative Anabaptists are the Dunkard Brethren Church, Conservative Mennonites, and Beachy Amish, as well as the Bruderhof Communities, Apostolic Christian Church and the Charity Christian Fellowship. Conservative Anabaptists form 15% of Anabaptist Christianity as a whole.
In response to a perceived laxity in adherence to Anabaptist doctrine and practice, certain Conservative Anabaptist denominations, such as the Biblical Mennonite Alliance and the Dunkard Brethren Church, were formed after adherents separated from their parent (usually mainline Anabaptist) bodies; on the other hand, the Beachy Mennonites are composed of individuals who left Old Order Anabaptist groups and ""were deeply committed to evangelism and mission work."" Other Conservative Anabaptist denominations, such as Charity Christian Fellowship, have been organized by people from diverse backgrounds.

Pay gap,"The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are employed.  Women are generally found to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience. In other words, the adjusted values represent how much women and men make for the same work, while the non-adjusted values represent how much the average man and woman make in total. In the United States, for example, the non-adjusted average woman's annual salary is 79–83% of the average man's salary, compared to 95–99% for the adjusted average salary.
The reasons for the gap link to legal, social and economic factors. These include having children (motherhood penalty vs. fatherhood bonus), parental leave, gender discrimination and gender norms. Additionally, the consequences of the gender pay gap surpass individual grievances, leading to reduced economic output, lower pensions for women, and fewer learning opportunities.
The gender pay gap can be a problem from a public policy perspective in developing countries because it reduces economic output and means that women are more likely to be dependent upon welfare payments, especially in old age.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap,Not an Event

Little Lake (Peterborough),"Little Lake is a small lake on the Otonabee River in the city of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The lake is in the downtown of the city and is used for fishing, swimming, boating, and for various special events. The lake lies on the water route from Lake Ontario to the Kawartha Lakes.
The area around the lake was first settled by Europeans around the start of the 19th century. 
Steam- and water-powered saw mills were built on the lake and on the river upstream to prepare lumber for shipment overseas.
Sawdust and other debris from the mills polluted the lake, killed the fish and clogged up the navigable channels.
The smell was so noxious it drove residents near the lake to move.
These problems were resolved by the end of the century, when the lake became a hub on the new Trent-Severn Waterway from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron.
However, industries attracted by cheap hydroelectric power, such as General Electric used the lake for disposal of industrial chemicals for many years. 
The pollutants seems to be mostly contained in the sediment, and the lake is now considered safe for recreational use.

African red slip ware,"African red slip ware, also African Red Slip or ARS, is a category of terra sigillata, or ""fine"" Ancient Roman pottery produced from the mid-1st century AD into the 7th century in the province of Africa Proconsularis, specifically that part roughly coinciding with the modern country of Tunisia and the Diocletianic provinces of  Byzacena and Zeugitana. It is distinguished by a thick-orange red slip over a slightly granular fabric. Interior surfaces are completely covered, while the exterior can be only partially slipped, particularly on later examples.
By the 3rd century AD, African red slip appears on sites throughout the Mediterranean and in the major cities of Roman Europe. It was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period, and occasional imports have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th-6th centuries.  African red slip ware was still widely distributed in the 5th century but after that time the volume of production and trade may well have declined. While the latest forms continued into the 7th century and are found in such major cities as Constantinople and Marseille, the breakup of commercial contacts that typified the later 7th century coincides with the final decline of the African red slip industry.
The production and success of African red slip is probably closely tied to the agricultural productivity of Rome's North African provinces, as indicated in part by the contemporaneous distribution of Roman-period North African amphoras.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_red_slip_ware,Not an Event

The point on the curve where these two differing slopes meet is called the light saturation point and is where the light-dependent reactions are producing more ATP and NADPH than can be utilized by the light-independent reactions.

Labor and the environment,"Labour and the environment are two different concepts that can be linked as one. Labour is defined as a task that is performed, typically for an economic return. Environment is defined as air, water, minerals, organisms, and all factors that contribute to ecology. It is the gregarious and cultural pressures that builds the lives of individuals or an entire population. Human labour in the forms of Logging, Mining, and Tourism, have negatively impacted the functions of the environment in various countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forum. The OECD is a list of 34 countries whose governments work together to ensure that the market economies function accordingly and strive to increase economic growth, wealth and sustainable development. The impacts of labour on the environment have been so large that many corporations and campaigns have begun, striving to change the way humans exert their abilities on the environment by implementing policies to limit negative outcomes.
Logging, Mining and Tourism damage the environment without proper resource management practices. Logging has created such a negative effect on New Zealand in particular, that a 3 year ban had been placed on logging to attempt to preserve the environment and reconstruct it to its original structure. The effects are dated as far back as 1960. At the end of the second world war, there were about 100,000 hectares of native forest, whereas today there is less than 17,000 hectares remaining in West Taupo District in New Zealand and many endangered species that resided in these forests are now extinct as a cause of logging. In terms of mining, the conflicts that have surfaced in Peru revolve around the inexperience workers that are hired to perform these tasks that incur a greater damage to the environment as they are not aware of the harm they are doing. There is a weakness around the environmental regulation in comparison to mining and many companies have taken over and negatively affected the environment in order to invest their wealth into new mining operations. Furthermore, tourism has contributed a great amount of stress to the environment. When individuals from other countries are visiting these OECD countries that are under great distress with the environment and pollution, in many cases they provide more harm than good by littering or removing plants or flowers as a souvenir but are unaware that the souvenirs are part of an endangered species. The popularity of tourism has resulted in damage towards the environment in many ways. Tourism has led to the growth of airports, hotels, and other organizations that have stripped away land in order to build and grow in the economic sector. Although tourism can have a positive impact on the economy it results in an environmentally unsustainable model for many areas.
The relationship between human labour and the environment and the types of work that humans have participated in have created a negative impact on many aspects of the environment including climate change and has resulted in the emerging green economy. The primary cause of climate change is humans and their work towards the environment overtime. A result of this has been the policies that have been put into place to ensure the environment will be protected moving forwards and to establish alternate routes for individuals when available to preserve the environment. The key focus is on the impact of human work on the environment, and the impact of the environment on human work. The green economy has emerged as a result of the negative outcomes. Specifically to Limpopo, Africa, there have been so many negative contributions affecting the way the environment functions that they have created a project to help reduce this issue. This project contributes to the green economy and has created policies that will be implemented to reduce negative outcomes and alternative routes when attaining energy, goods, infrastructure, etc.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_and_the_environment,Not an Event

The date was chosen by boycott organizers to coincide with May Day, the International Workers Day observed as a national holiday in Asia, most of Europe, and Mexico, but not officially recognized in the United States due to its Communist associations to some, and a separate Labor Day (a holiday it shares with Canada) in early September.
As a continuation of the 2006 US immigration reform protests, the organizers called for supporters to abstain from buying, selling, working, and attending school, in order to attempt to demonstrate through the extent to which the labor obtained of undocumented immigrants is needed.  Supporters of the boycott rallied in major cities across the US to demand general amnesty and legalization programs for illegal immigrants. For this reason, the day was referred to as ""A Day Without an Immigrant"", a reference to the 2004 political satire film, A Day Without a Mexican.
Though most demonstrations were peaceful, a Vista, California rally took a violent turn at day's end when crowds began throwing rocks and bottles at sheriff's deputies.  There were also two arrests made at a demonstration in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park.

Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System,"The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is a flight stabilizing feature developed by Boeing that became notorious for its role in two fatal accidents of the 737 MAX in 2018 and 2019, which killed all 346 passengers and crew among both flights. 
Because the CFM International LEAP engine used on the 737 MAX was larger and mounted further forward from the wing and higher off the ground than on previous generations of the 737, Boeing discovered that the aircraft had a tendency to push the nose up when operating in a specific portion of the flight envelope (flaps up, high angle of attack, manual flight). MCAS was intended to mimic the flight behavior of the previous Boeing 737 Next Generation. The company indicated that this change eliminated the need for pilots to have simulator training on the new aircraft.
After the fatal crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) referred pilots to a revised trim runaway checklist that must be performed in case of a malfunction. Boeing then received many requests for more information and revealed the existence of MCAS in another message, and that it could intervene without pilot input. According to Boeing, MCAS was implemented to compensate for an excessive angle of attack by adjusting the horizontal stabilizer before the aircraft would potentially stall. Boeing denied that MCAS was an anti-stall system, and stressed that it was intended to improve the handling of the aircraft while operating in a specific portion of the flight envelope. Following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019, Ethiopian authorities stated that the procedure did not enable the crew to prevent the accident, however further investigation revealed that the pilots did not follow the procedure properly. The Civil Aviation Administration of China then ordered the grounding of all 737 MAX planes in China, which led to more groundings across the globe.
Boeing admitted MCAS played a role in both accidents, when it acted on false data from a single angle of attack (AoA) sensor. In 2020, the FAA, Transport Canada, and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) evaluated flight test results with MCAS disabled, and suggested that the MAX might not have needed MCAS to conform to certification standards. Later that year, an FAA Airworthiness Directive approved design changes for each MAX aircraft, which would prevent MCAS activation unless both AoA sensors register similar readings, eliminate MCAS's ability to repeatedly activate, and allow pilots to override the system if necessary. The FAA began requiring all MAX pilots to undergo MCAS-related training in flight simulators by 2021.

It is a brood parasite which lays its eggs in the nest of the African quailfinch, Ortygospiza atricollis, a slightly unusual host since it is only a distant relative to the firefinches parasitised by most indigobirds. It does not destroy the host's egg, but its own eggs are added to those already present.
The adult male quailfinch indigobird has greenish-black plumage, and the female resembles a female house sparrow, with streaked brown upperparts, buff underparts and a whitish supercilium.
Many of the indigobirds are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. A helpful pointer is the association with the host species, the quailfinch.

Cronk ny Merriu,"Cronk ny Merriu (English: Hill of the Dead), located close to Port Grenaugh, is one of the remains of promontory forts in the Isle of Man. Cronk ny Merriu was previously considered by historians to be a prehistoric burial place due to its large grass-covered bank and name, literally translating to ""Hill of the Dead"". The bank and ditch created a defensive promontory fort at Cronk ny Merriu. Later, a rectangular building of Norse style and layout stood here, part of a system of coastal lookout posts used to protect the coastline and to police beach markets. Excavations of Cronk ny Merriu show that there was very little domestic activity, and that the Norse building likely didn't have permanent residency. It's suggested that the longhouse was primarily a building for those at nearby forts to shelter from harsh weather, rather than a place of defence itself. Although no scientific dating has been done, due to the similarities with fortified headlands throughout the Anglo-Celtic isles, archeologists strongly believe that this site dates back to the Celtic Iron Age.
Several of the lookout posts, especially in Santon, where Cronk ny Merriu is situated, can be visited using the coastal footpath. The posts were protected with a deep ditch and a rampart strengthed by large stones on their vulnerable landward side. There'd also be a heavily protected gateway, with ramparts built up on either side, for those seeking shelter in the fort.
The Scandinavians who arrived in Mann in the eighth and ninth centuries sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts, often obliterating the old domestic quarters with their characteristic rectangular houses; the example at Cronk ny Merriu has been used as the basis of the reconstruction of the House of Manannan museum in Peel.

Servante,"A domestic worker is a person who works within a residence and performs a variety of household services for an individual, from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands. The term ""domestic service"" applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be ""in service"".
Some domestic workers live within their employer's household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.
Servant is an older English word for ""domestic worker"", though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called ""service"" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In Britain, a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the Victorian era (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_worker,Not an Event

Cacoxenite,"Cacoxenite is an iron aluminium phosphate mineral with formula: Fe3+24Al(PO4)17O6(OH)12·17(H2O). Cacoxenite is associated with iron ores. The name comes from the Greek κăκός for ""bad"" or ""evil"" and ξένος for ""guest"" because the phosphorus content of cacoxenite lessens the quality of iron smelted from ore containing it.
It was first described in 1825 for an occurrence in the Hrbek Mine, Bohemia, Czech Republic. It occurs as a secondary phase in oxidized magnetite and limonite deposits. It also occurs in novaculites and in iron and phosphorus rich sediments.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacoxenite,Not an Event

Recreational diving,"Recreational diving or sport diving is diving for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment, usually when using scuba equipment.  The term ""recreational diving"" may also be used in contradistinction to ""technical diving"", a more demanding aspect of recreational diving which requires more training and experience to develop the competence to reliably manage more complex equipment in the more hazardous conditions associated with the disciplines. Breath-hold diving for recreation also fits into the broader scope of the term, but this article covers the commonly used meaning of scuba diving for recreational purposes, where the diver is not constrained from making a direct near-vertical ascent to the surface at any point during the dive, and risk is considered low.
The equipment used for recreational diving is mostly open circuit scuba, though semi closed and fully automated electronic closed circuit rebreathers may be included in the scope of recreational diving. Risk is managed by training the diver in a range of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to the equipment the diver chooses to use and the environment in which the diver plans to dive. Further experience and development of skills by practice will improve the diver's ability to dive safely. Specialty training is made available by the recreational diver training industry and diving clubs to increase the range of environments and venues the diver can enjoy at an acceptable level of risk.
Reasons to dive and preferred diving activities may vary during the personal development of a recreational diver, and may depend on their psychological profile and their level of dedication to the activity. Most divers average less than eight dives per year, but some total several thousand dives over a few decades and continue diving into their 60s and 70s, occasionally older. Recreational divers may frequent local dive sites or dive as tourists at more distant venues known for desirable underwater environments. An economically significant diving tourism industry services recreational divers, providing equipment, training and diving experiences, generally by specialist providers known as dive centers, dive schools, live-aboard, day charter and basic dive boats.
Legal constraints on recreational diving vary considerably across jurisdictions. Recreational diving may be industry regulated or regulated by law to some extent. The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear, but buddy diving is generally recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs. The evidence supporting this policy is inconclusive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_diving,Not an Event
Castlebourne folly,"The Castlebourne folly in the parish of Belbroughton, Worcestershire, England, was built as a sham castle towards the end of the eighteenth century and is similar in age and design to Clent Castle, another folly, about 2.2 miles (3.5 km) away in an adjacent parish of Clent.

New Middle Class,"The middle class refers to a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy, often defined by occupation, income, education, or social status. The term has historically been associated with modernity, capitalism and political debate. Common definitions for the middle class range from the middle fifth of individuals on a nation's income ladder, to everyone but the poorest and wealthiest 20%. Theories like ""Paradox of Interest"" use decile groups and wealth distribution data to determine the size and wealth share of the middle class.
Terminology differs in the United States, where the term middle class describes people who in other countries would be described as working class. There has been significant global middle-class growth over time. In February 2009, The Economist asserted that over half of the world's population belonged to the middle class, as a result of rapid growth in emerging countries. It characterized the middle class as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter.

Construction of the cave was completed in 2004 and glowworms introduced in September that year, ready for the October breeding season, with the caves opening to visitors in March 2005.  It's envisaged that the colony will become self-sufficient.  Insects for the glowworms are caught by daily sweep netting of the grounds and through buckets filled with rotten fruit that attract fruit flies. Humidity and moisture are controlled with a high-pressure misting system that is run every two hours, however, no other temperature control is utilised.
Tours consist of a seven-minute DVD (available in English, Mandarin, Japanese and Korean), photo opportunities in front of the stalactites and stalagmites, and finally a 15-minute tour through ""glow worm alley"". Visitors are able to see the glow worms under a red torchlight, and have access to a fully knowledgeable tour guide.

Kibei,"Kibbeh (, also kubba and other spellings; Arabic: كبة, romanized: kibba) is a popular dish in the Levant based on spiced lean ground meat and bulgur wheat. Kibbeh is considered to be a national dish of Syria and Lebanon. 
In Levantine cuisine, kibbeh is made by pounding bulgur wheat together with meat into a fine paste and forming it into ovoid shapes, with toasted pine nuts and spices. It may also be layered and cooked on a tray, deep-fried, grilled, or served raw. The Syrian city of Aleppo can lay claim to at least 17 types of kibbeh. In Mesopotamian cuisine, versions with rice or farina are found.
Outside of Syria, versions are found in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, the  Persian Gulf, Armenia, and Turkey, and among Assyrian people. It is also found throughout Latin American countries that received substantial numbers of immigrants from the Levant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as parts of North America.

Inert salt,"In chemistry, an inert salt is a salt used to adjust the ionic strength of a solution. This is usually done in equilibrium or kinetic studies in order to reduce relative changes in the ionic strength of a solution. The real goal is to reduce changes in the activity coefficients of ionic species which allows the definition of conditional equilibrium or rate constants.
Any salt will affect the ionic strength, inert salts have the additional property that both the cations and the anions of the salt do or should not not interfere in any way with the molecules that are investigated. They are supposed to only influence the ionic strength.
Typical inert salts that are used include: NaClO4, NaCl, KNO3, NaNO3, triflates (e.g. NaOSO2CF3). 
Inert salts are never perfectly inert and their use will always interfere with the process under investigation, although the influence may be negligible.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inert_salt,Not an Event

Quantum well infrared photodetector,"A Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) is an infrared photodetector, which uses electronic intersubband transitions in quantum wells to absorb photons. In order to be used for infrared detection, the parameters of the quantum wells in the quantum well infrared photodetector are adjusted so that the energy difference between its first and second quantized states match the incoming infrared photon energy. QWIPs are typically made of gallium arsenide, a material commonly found in smartphones and high-speed communications equipment. Depending on the material and the design of the quantum wells, the energy levels of the QWIP can be tailored to absorb radiation in the infrared region from 3 to 20 μm.
QWIPs are one of the simplest quantum mechanical device structures that can detect mid-wavelength and long-wavelength infrared radiation.

Nonsynonymous substitution,"A nonsynonymous substitution is a nucleotide mutation that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein. Nonsynonymous substitutions differ from synonymous substitutions, which do not alter amino acid sequences and are (sometimes) silent mutations.

Nonsynonymous substitutions at a certain locus can be compared to the synonymous substitutions at the same locus to obtain the Ka/Ks ratio. This ratio is used to measure the evolutionary rate of gene sequences. If a gene has lower levels of nonsynonymous than synonymous nucleotide substitution, then it can be inferred to be functional because a Ka/Ks ratio < 1 is a hallmark of sequences that are being constrained to code for proteins.
 Nonsynonymous substitutions are also referred to as replacement mutations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsynonymous_substitution,Not an Event

The banknotes were issued into circulation on 19 July 1937, at which time the Bank of Canada began gradually removing banknotes from the 1935 series from circulation. The $1000 banknote was issued several years later, as it was primarily used by chartered banks, which had a sufficient supply of the 1935 Series $1000 banknote.
This was the first series of bilingual Canadian banknotes, as the 1935 Series was a dual-language series with French banknotes issued in Quebec and English banknotes issued in the rest of Canada. This series was created because of the introduction of the Bank of Canada Act, which required Canadian banknotes to be bilingual. In this series, English was always on the left. The 1937 banknote series was followed by the 1954 Canadian Landscape series.
With the exception of the $50 and $1000 notes, the colours introduced to the notes on this series remain to this day (or until they were no longer produced).

Phrynopus remotum,"Phrynopus remotum is a species of frog in the family Strabomantidae. It is native to the central Andes of Peru in the Department of Huánuco at elevations of 3,730 meters. The frog is found in a single locality in a section of highlands adjacent to Marañón Dry valley in habitats such as grasslands, cloud forests, and alongside temporary streams. It can be found under rocks, moss, and other cover. The frog is small, with males reaching 19.3 to 23.3 mm (0.76 to 0.92 in) SVL and females 28.7 mm (1.13 in) SVL. Due to the lack of sufficient water in its habitat, these frogs will lay their eggs in damp areas and the tadpoles will undergo metamorphosis inside the egg, later hatching as fully formed froglets.
The specific name remotum comes from the remote areas the frog is found in, which took over thirty hours of travelling through harsh terrain to reach. The only other amphibian that was found in the same habitat as Phrynopus remotum was the Peru marsupial frog (Gastrotheca peruana), which also does not have aquatic tadpoles.

Fail-safes in nanotechnology,"Fail-safes in nanotechnology are devices or features integrated with nanotechnology which, in the event of failure, respond in a way that will cause no harm, or at least a minimum of harm, to other devices or personnel. Fail-safe principles are governed by national standards and engineering practices, and are widely used in conventional engineering design. It is possible to scale down macro-scale fail-safe principles and devices for similar applications at the nano-scale. The use of fail-safes in nanotechnology applications supports social acceptance of those applications by reducing the risks to users; as of 2009, there are both theoretical and practical ways to implement fail-safe designs in nanotechnology.
A predominant challenge to the social acceptance of nanotechnology is concerned with the medical use of nanostructures in the human body. While any structure for medical use would be developed to be bio-compatible and harmless, sound engineering design must take into account all possibilities of failure. Thus, the design would include ways to manipulate the structures in the body in the event of failure.

Classical Islam,"The concept of classical Islam or a classical period in the history of Islam is largely a construct of non-Islamic scholarship, formed by analogy with the classical period of the Greco-Roman world. The term implies a positive judgement defining a ""normative period"" in Islamic history, but western scholars generally extend the period much later than Muslim scholars would allow. The Muslim conception of a normative period corresponds mainly to that of the Companions of the Prophet and the Rightly Guided Caliphs, roughly the seventh century.
There is no consistency in western usage. The term may be given a primarily religious sense, meaning ""the era when the classics of Islamic law and spirituality were written"", extending down to about 1400. Or it may take on a political sense, meaning ""the major chain of political legitimacy"" that came to end with the fall of Baghdad in 1258. Although ""reality had failed to conform for rather more than four centuries"" to the ideal of the caliphate, the collapse of 1258 represents a fundamental psychological break in Islamic history. In a more restricted sense, Islamic ""classical civilization"" corresponds to the ""high caliphal"" period of the Umayyads and Abbasids from about 692 to 945, when ""Islamicate society formed a single vast state"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Islam,Not an Event

Nole,"The Nile (also known as the Nile River) is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa. It has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer. Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water. About 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan. The Nile is an important economic driver supporting agriculture and fishing.
The Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.
The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Nubian Desert to Cairo and its large delta, and the river flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river and its annual flooding since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of the Aswan Dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. The Nile is, with the Rhône and Po, one of the three Mediterranean rivers with the largest water discharge.

Moenave became a notable destination after the completion of U.S. Route 160 through Arizona. During construction, it was discovered that a large concentration of dinosaur tracks have been preserved in what was once a shallow marshland. It is apparent that the area dried very quickly, turning the mud along with the dinosaur tracks into hardened rock, preserving them for millions of years. Well defined tracks made by Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, Pterodactylus, and many others species can be found at the site. In addition to the tracks, poorly preserved remains of dinosaur bones and raptor claws can be found in the area. The best preserved fossils discovered in Moenave were removed by paleontologists to be displayed in museums.

Grand Burgher,"Grand Burgher [male] or Grand Burgheress [female] (from German: Großbürger [male], Großbürgerin [female]) is a specific conferred or inherited title of medieval German origin and legally defined preeminent status granting exclusive constitutional privileges and legal rights (German: Großbürgerrecht). Grand Burghers were magnates and subordinate only to the Emperor, independent of feudalism and territorial nobility or lords paramount. 
A member class within the patrician ruling elite, the Grand Burgher was a type of urban citizen and social order of highest rank.  They existed as a formally defined upper social class, made up of affluent individuals and elite burgher families in medieval German-speaking city-states and towns under the Holy Roman Empire. They usually came from a wealthy business or significant mercantile background and estate. This hereditary title (and influential constitutional status) was privy to very few individuals and families across Central Europe. The title formally existed well into the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century. 
In some instances, the Grand Burghers (Großbürger) or patricians (""Patrizier"") constituted the ruling class. This was true in autonomous German-speaking cities and towns of Central Europe that held a municipal charter, town privileges (German town law). Grand Burghers also existed as a ruling class in free imperial cities (such as Hamburg, Augsburg, Cologne, and Bern) that held imperial immediacy, or where nobility had no power of authority or supremacy.

A Ship of the Line,"A ship of the line was a type of naval warship constructed during the Age of Sail from the 17th century to the mid-19th century. The ship of the line was designed for the naval tactic known as the line of battle, which involved the two columns of opposing warships manoeuvering to volley fire with the cannons along their broadsides. In conflicts where opposing ships were both able to fire from their broadsides, the faction with more cannons firing – and therefore more firepower – typically had an advantage.
From the end of the 1840s, the introduction of steam power brought less dependence on the wind in battle and led to the construction of screw-driven wooden-hulled ships of the line; a number of purely sail-powered ships were converted to this propulsion mechanism. However, the rise of the ironclad frigate, starting in 1859, made steam-assisted ships of the line obsolete. The ironclad warship became the ancestor of the 20th-century battleship, whose very designation is itself a contraction of the phrase ""ship of the line of battle"" or, more colloquially, ""battleship of the line"".
The term ""ship of the line"" fell into disuse except in historical contexts, after warships and naval tactics evolved and changed from the mid-19th century. Some other languages did keep the name however; the Imperial German Navy called its battleships Linienschiffe until World War I.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_the_line,Not an Event

Phytochrome,"Phytochromes are a class of photoreceptor proteins found in plants, bacteria and fungi. They respond to light in the red and far-red regions of the visible spectrum and can be classed as either Type I, which are activated by far-red light, or Type II that are activated by red light. Recent advances have suggested that phytochromes also act as temperature sensors, as warmer temperatures enhance their de-activation. All of these factors contribute to the plant's ability to germinate.
Phytochromes control many aspects of plant development. They regulate the germination of seeds (photoblasty), the synthesis of chlorophyll, the elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number and movement of leaves and the timing of flowering in adult plants. Phytochromes are widely expressed across many tissues and developmental stages.
Other plant photoreceptors include cryptochromes and phototropins, which respond to blue and ultraviolet-A light and UVR8, which is sensitive to ultraviolet-B light.
